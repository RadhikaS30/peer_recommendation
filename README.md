# Peer Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
The Peer Recommendation System is designed to connect users with relevant peers based on shared interests, skills, or preferences.  
The system analyzes user data and suggests meaningful connections using recommendation logic.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning concepts and system design principles in building a real-world recommendation platform.

---

## 🚀 Features
- User profile creation
- Interest-based similarity matching
- Peer suggestion generation
- Simple and scalable recommendation logic
- Clean and modular backend structure

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The recommendation logic is based on:

- Similarity scoring between users
- Feature comparison (skills, interests, preferences)
- Ranking potential peers based on relevance

The system can be extended to use:
- Cosine similarity
- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Graph-based recommendation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- HTML/CSS (if frontend included)
- Flask / Django (if backend used)
- Git & GitHub

## 📊 How It Works

1. User registers with interests and skills.
2. The system compares user attributes.
3. A similarity score is calculated.
4. Top matching peers are recommended.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add machine learning-based collaborative filtering
- Deploy on cloud (AWS / Render / Heroku)
- Add authentication system
- Add database integration (MySQL / MongoDB)
- Build REST API version

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding recommendation system basics
- Applying similarity metrics
- Backend development and system structuring
- Version control using Git
