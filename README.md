# Deep Learning-Based Pneumonia Detection

## Problem Statement
Automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using CNNs.

## Dataset
Chest X-ray dataset with NORMAL and PNEUMONIA classes.

## Methodology
- Image resizing
- CNN model
- Cross-Entropy Loss
- Adam Optimizer

## Results
- Training Loss: ...
- Model trained for 3 epochs
- Future improvement: Transfer Learning (ResNet)

## Future Work
- Add validation accuracy
- Use pretrained ResNet
- Add confusion matrix
